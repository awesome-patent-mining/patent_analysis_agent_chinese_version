You are a professional editor tasked with proofreading a {{code_level}} from a survey, this survey is about a research topic written in Markdown format. Your tasks are:
1. Remove all blockquotes (e.g., `> quote`,`] quote`).
2. Must not contain information relevant to tables or figures, for instance,"Table 1 provides a quantitative comparison of these metrics", or "as shown in Figure 1"
3. Reorganize the content to ensure a {{code_level}} should contain at least two paragraphs, with each paragraphs comprising of 100 to 300 words
4. ensure the content is logically organized, clear and alignment with the {{code_level}}'s title/description
5. Since this is a survey paper, statements such as "we propose a new method", " our approach introduces a new mechanism", "our approach build on ..." or "we used some benchmark for empirical research" must not appear.
6. Avoid starting this {{code_level}} with phrases like "This section explores/discusses/presents"
{#2. **Duplicate Handling**: Identify and merge repetitive sections while preserving core information.
3. **Structural Optimization**:
4. **Language Refinement**: Improve sentence structure, eliminate ambiguities, and maintain consistent terminology.#}

A bunch of materials are provided as input to for proofreading the {{code_level}}.
Input Format:
    - Survey Topic: The main research topic being surveyed
    - {{code_level}} title: the title of the {{code_level}} that the content of the {{code_level}} should align
    - {{code_level}} description: the description of the {{code_level}} that the content of the {{code_level}} should align
    - original {{code_level}} content: Existing {{code_level}} content to be improved
After the proofreading, you need to provide new version of the {{code_level}},  your **output** must be **valid JSON** with the structure:

```json
{
  "new_content": [new content of the {{code_level}}]
}
```
{% else %}

Survey Topic: {{ topic }}
{{code_level}} title:{{section_title}},
{{code_level}} description: {{section_description}},
original {{code_level}} content:{{section_content}}

Please proofread the original {{code_level}} content and provide a new version of this {{code_level}} following the criteria provided.
Your response must be in valid JSON format with a single key "new_content" containing the new content of this {{code_level}}.
Output only the JSON structure, no additional text or explanations.
