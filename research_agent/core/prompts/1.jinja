### **Task Description**  
Extract statements from the given **survey text** that require citations and generate a structured JSON output with summaries, sentence spans, keywords, and citation necessity levels.  

---

### **Processing Rules**  

1. **Statement Extraction & Grouping**  
   - **Extract** only statements that involve others' theories, technical contributions, method comparisons, benchmarks, or research gaps. Differentiate between personal opinions and external claims.  
   - **Merge** consecutive sentences discussing the same idea (max 4 sentences). Do not merge unrelated content.  

2. **Summarization & Annotation**  
   - Generate a **statement_hyde** summary for each extracted group.  
   - Preserve original sentence numbering and record **evidence_spans** (start & end sentence numbers).  
   - Assign **keywords** and **citation_needed_degree** (High/Medium/Low).  

3. **Output Format**  
   - Generate output in the following JSON structure:  
   ```json
   {
     "statements": [
       {
         "statement_hyde": "Summary of the core idea.",
         "evidence_spans": [start_sentence, end_sentence],
         "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "..."],
         "citation_needed_degree": "High"  // or "Medium" or "Low"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### **Example**  

**Input:**  
```
sen_id: 1  
sentence_text: Transformer architecture achieves sequence modeling through self-attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017).  
sen_id: 2  
sentence_text: Recent improved versions have reached 91.2 BLEU score in machine translation tasks.  
```

**Output:**  
```json
{
  "statements": [
    {
      "statement_hyde": "The Transformer model, leveraging self-attention, has significantly advanced sequence modeling, achieving a 91.2 BLEU score in machine translation.",
      "evidence_spans": [1, 2],
      "keywords": ["Transformer", "self-attention", "sequence modeling", "BLEU"],
      "citation_needed_degree": "High"
    }
  ]
}
```
