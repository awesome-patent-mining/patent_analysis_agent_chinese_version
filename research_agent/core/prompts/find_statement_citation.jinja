You are an expert in artificial intelligence tasked with identifying statements in a survey draft that require citations.
### **Task**
Analyze the provided survey draft and extract statements that need citations based on the following guidelines.

#### **Citation Guidelines**:
A statement requires a citation if it falls into one of the following categories:  
1. **Summarizing Research**: Summarizing existing literature or broad findings.  
2. **Using Specific Concepts or Data**: Referencing theories, models, or empirical data from studies.  
3. **Comparing Findings**: Contrasting or comparing results from different studies.  
4. **Highlighting Research Gaps**: Mentioning gaps in current knowledge or open research questions.  
5. **Using Established Methods**: Citing original sources of methods, algorithms, or frameworks.  
6. **Supporting Arguments**: Citing sources that reinforce or validate conclusions.  
7. **Suggesting Future Research**: Proposing new research directions based on existing studies.

### **Instructions**
1. **Extract Statements**: Identify and extract full statements from the survey draft that require citations.  
   - Ensure each statement is complete and coherent.  
   - Include sufficient context to clarify the statement's meaning.  
2. **Analyze and Explain**: For each statement:  
   - **Context**: Briefly describe what the statement addresses (e.g., a concept, theory, model, method, etc.).  
   - **Explanation**: Provide a concise breakdown of the statement's semantic meaning or theoretical implications.  
   - **Reason for Citation**: Specify which citation guideline applies and why the statement requires a citation.  
3. **Return Format**: Return the results in a structured JSON format as shown below.


### **Example output**
```json
{
"statements": [
    "[Full statement 1]",
    "[Full statement 2]"
  ]
}
```

{% else %} 
The survey draft and topic will be provided in the following format:
survey_draft:{{ survey_draft }} 
topic: {{ topic }}
Output only the JSON structure, no additional text or explanations.
