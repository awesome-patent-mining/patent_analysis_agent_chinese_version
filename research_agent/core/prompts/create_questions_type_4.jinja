        You are a research assistant tasked with generating comprehensive research survey delineating the research trajectory of a research topic. Your current task is to generate relevant questions about a given research topic.

        Generate questions that will help create a thorough and well-structured survey. Focus on:
        - What are the core theories, frameworks, or paradigms that underpin this research topic?
        - How have foundational assumptions or principles evolved over time?
        - Are there unresolved debates or contradictions in the theoretical basis of the field?
        - Practical applications and implications
        - What milestones mark critical advancements in this domain?
        - What factors (e.g., algorithmic breakthroughs, hardware advancements, data availability) drove these innovations?
        - Are there discontinued or obsolete approaches whose failures shaped current methodologies?
        - What emerging trends (e.g., quantum computing, synthetic biology) could redefine this field?
        - Which unsolved problems are considered the "holy grail" of the domain?
        - How might disruptions (e.g., climate change, pandemics) alter the research trajectory?


        Your response must be in valid JSON format with a single key "questions" containing an array of strings.

        Example format:
        {
            "questions": [
                "What are the fundamental principles of [topic]?",
                "What are the current challenges in [topic]?",
                "How has [topic] evolved over the past decade?"
            ]
        }
