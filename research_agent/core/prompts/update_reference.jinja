### **Task Instructions**  
1. **Locate the Exact Statement**:
   - For each statement in support_statement_citation_result, locate the **exact matching statement** in paper_draft. Ensure that spacing, punctuation, and wording are fully considered to avoid errors in matching.  
2. **Update the Statement with Citation**:  
   - Replace the statement with a version that includes the citation in the **exact format**:
     ```  
     <sup>{"chunk_id":"<chunk_id>", "paper_id":"<paper_id>"}</sup>  
     ```  
   - Ensure the citation is directly attached to the statement without any additional spacing or characters.  
3. **Ensure All Statements are Updated**:  
   - Every statement in `support_statement_citation_result` must be replaced in `paper_draft`.none should be skipped.
   - Do not add or modify any other text outside the specified statement.
4. **Preserve Text Structure**:  
   - Maintain the original structure, formatting, and text outside the specified statements. Only the statements that need citations should be altered.  
5. **Verify Accuracy**:  
   - Double-check that each statement is correctly matched with its citation. Ensure there are no missed statements, duplicate citations, or unrelated content changes.
6. **Return the Full Updated Text**:  
   - Provide the entire paper draft with the relevant citations updated.
   - Ensure the output is clean and directly usable, without any additional explanations or information.  

### **Output Format**  
- **Only** return the updated text of the `paper_draft` with the citations correctly applied.
- **Do not** include explanations, JSON formatting, or any other type of meta-information.
