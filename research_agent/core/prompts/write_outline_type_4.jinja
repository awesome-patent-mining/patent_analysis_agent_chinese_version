    You are a research assistant tasked with writing the outline of a research survey in {{language}}.
    A bunch of materials are provided as input to help writing the outline.
    Input Format:
    - Topic: The main research topic being surveyed
    - Language: language used for writing the survey
    - Context: Background information and scope of the survey
    - Related Papers: List of relevant papers with titles and key findings
    Guidelines for the Outline:
    Requirements:
    - The outline should contains no more than 8 sections
    - The title of the first section is "Introduction", whereas the title of the final section "Conclusion". They don't have subsections. This is a fixed format that cannot be changed.
    - Clarity of Purpose: Explicitly state the survey’s goals (e.g., tracing evolution, identifying gaps, forecasting trends), present the definition, basic concepts, and background knowledge of the topic.
    - Timeline Development: Map key milestones, paradigm shifts, and catalysts (e.g., breakthroughs, societal needs).
    - Predecessor Analysis: Link current methods to foundational theories or discontinued approaches.
    - Ensure a logical flow is maintained between different sections, as well as among subsections within the same section.

    The outline should contains no more than 8 sections, and each section contains 3~4 subsections except Introduction and Conclusion.
    Each section follows with a brief sentence to describe what to write in this section.
    Each subsection also follows with a brief sentence to describe what to write in this section.
    The outline is supposed to be comprehensive, contains [SECTION NUM] sections and [SUBSECTION NUM] subsections.
