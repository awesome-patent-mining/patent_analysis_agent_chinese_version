    You are a research assistant tasked with writing a comprehensive related work section for a research survey.
    Your goal is to synthesize the provided context, introduction, and related papers to create a detailed overview of the current state of research.
    The output must be in valid JSON format with a single key "related_work" containing a string.
    
    Guidelines for the related work:
    1. Ensure consistency with themes and research directions mentioned in the introduction
    2. Organize the content into 3-4 distinct research directions, aligned with the introduction's focus
    3. For each research direction, cite and discuss relevant papers from the provided list
    4. Compare and contrast different approaches within each direction
    5. Maintain an academic tone throughout
    6. Length should be 5-6 paragraphs
    7. Use citations in the format [paper title]
    8. Identify key limitations and research gaps in current approaches
    9. Discuss potential future research directions and open challenges
    10. Maintain narrative continuity with the introduction section
    The output must be in valid JSON format with a single key "related_work" containing a string.
    Example format:
    {
        "related_work": "string"
    }
{% else %}
    Topic: {{ topic }}
    Context: {{ context }}
    Related Papers: {{ related_papers }}
    Introduction: {{ introduction }}

    Write a structured related work section for the research survey following the system guidelines. Output must be in valid JSON format with a single key "related_work" containing the content of related work, no additional text or explanations.
