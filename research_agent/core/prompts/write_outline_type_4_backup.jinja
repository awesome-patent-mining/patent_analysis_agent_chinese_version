Highlights are made on technological advancements and advantages achieved by these milestones compared to prior technologies, as well as their main application fields, defects and shortcomings.
    - After the above milestone sections, another section is devoted to discussing the challenges and difficulties currently being faced in this field, as well as a prospective glance at potential future developments.
    - Ensure a logical flow is maintained between different sections, as well as among subsections within the same section.

    The outline should contains no more than 8 sections, and each section contains 3~4 subsections except Introduction and Conclusion.
    Each section follows with a brief sentence to describe what to write in this section.
