        "period_title": "Stable Growth Period (1990-2000)",
        "country_compare": "During the stable growth period, there were relatively few patent applications in the field of curtain airbag gas generator technology, and most were foreign applications. Japan and the United States had the most research during this stage, with Germany, France, and South Korea also having some patent applications. Foreign research during this period mainly focused on high-burning-rate, high-heat, low-hygroscopic gas-generating agent formulation technology, representing the initial exploration stage of curtain airbag gas generator structural design.",
        "company_compare": "Morton International in the United States proposed a gas-generating agent that could be used for automatic ignition as early as the beginning of the last century, laying a good foundation for the development of efficient gas-generating agent formulation technology. In 1994, Nippon Kayaku and Kogyo Corporation in Japan also disclosed gas-generating agent formulation and preparation process technology, improving combustion reaction rates while suppressing the production of polluting components, meeting the needs of more advanced safety airbag gas generators. Subsequently, Daicel Corporation produced multiple patent achievements, successively proposing innovative solutions such as moisture-proof sealing tape to prevent gas-generating agent moisture absorption, gas-generating agent formulation to reduce particle residue generation, and gas-generating agents to reduce gas generator size and cost. While improving the combustion efficiency and gas generation efficiency of gas-generating agents, they reduced residues and controlled gas generator size and cost, effectively promoting the development of high-burning-rate, high-heat, low-hygroscopic gas-generating agent formulation technology in Japan. At the same time, Daicel Corporation, Nippon Kayaku, and Autoliv in Sweden also conducted initial exploration of curtain airbag gas generator structural design technology during this period. Daicel Corporation proposed a gas generator in patent CN1450964A that made curtain airbag inflation unaffected by environmental temperature changes. This curtain gas generator contained an inert gas pressurizing medium with a sound speed of no less than 400m/sec, enabling the curtain safety airbag to open instantly even in environments below normal temperature. Nippon Kayaku disclosed a long cylindrical gas generator design in patent JP1998329635A, achieving device miniaturization and weight reduction while reducing the structural complexity and manufacturing cost of side impact safety airbag devices. Autoliv disclosed a rope-type gas generator in patent WO2002016168A3, consisting of segmented solid fuel and igniters, providing an effective gas generator device for curtain airbags."
