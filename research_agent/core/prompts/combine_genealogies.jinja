        Now you have two Hierarchical Structure Diagrams about [topic], one is created based on Patents and the other is based on Webpages.
        Your task is to organically integrate two hierarchical structure diagrams into a single, comprehensive, and coherent diagram in {{language}} that accurately reflects the technological topic.
        A hierarchical structure diagram about a technological topic refers to decomposing the topic into sub-technologies by levels.
    For example, in the case of "Development of Gas Generators for Curtain Airbags in Automobiles," the corresponding hierarchical structure diagram is as follows:

    [{'Primary Technology': ['Overall Structural Design Technology of Gas Generators'], 'Secondary Technology': ['Ignition System Technology', 'Inflation Method Technology', 'Component Structure Technology']},
    {'Primary Technology': ['High-Pressure Gas Sealing and Storage Technology'], 'Secondary Technology': ['Manufacturing Process Technology', 'Resistant Material Technology']},
    {'Primary Technology': ['High Burn Rate, High Heat, Low Hygroscopic Gas Generating Agent Formulation Technology'], 'Secondary Technology': ['Propellant Manufacturing Process Technology', 'Propellant Formulation Technology']}]

    The combined diagram should effectively present core technologies, major branches, and their relationships, supporting in-depth technical analysis and innovation.

    Guideline for combining two hierarchical structure diagrams:

    - Center the diagram around the main technological theme.
    - Maintain consistent layering logic (e.g., primary technology → secondary technology).
    - Leverage patent data for systematic coverage of innovations, technical standards, and established bottlenecks.
    - Use web data to capture emerging trends, cross-disciplinary integration, and popular discussion points.
    - Merge duplicate technical branches from both diagrams to avoid redundancy.
    - Combine differently phrased but essentially similar technological items into unified branches.
    - If a branch is further subdivided in one data source, extend the hierarchy accordingly to enrich the diagram’s depth.
    - Retain unique technologies, novel applications, or interdisciplinary elements specific to each data source to enhance comprehensiveness.
    - Ensure that each hierarchical level remains consistent and logically connected throughout the integrated diagram.
    - Focus on technological content, excluding non-technical aspects such as policies and regulations, talent cultivation, and ethical discussions.

    Input Format:
    - topic: The technological topic of the hierarchical structure diagrams
    - genealogy_web: the first hierarchical structure diagram created based on webpages
    - genealogy_patent: the second hierarchical structure diagram created based on patents
    - language: the language used to output the combined hierarchical structure diagram

    Return in the following format:
    <format>
    {% if language == "English" %}
        [{'Primary Technology':[DESCRIPTION OF PRIMARY TECHNOLOGY 1],'Secondary Technology',[DESCRIPTION OF SECONDARY TECHNOLOGY 1,DESCRIPTION OF SECONDARY TECHNOLOGY 2,...]},
        {'Primary Technology':[DESCRIPTION OF PRIMARY TECHNOLOGY 2],'Secondary Technology',[DESCRIPTION OF SECONDARY TECHNOLOGY 1,DESCRIPTION OF SECONDARY TECHNOLOGY 2,...]},
        ...]
    {% else %}
        [{'一级技术':[一级技术1的相关描述],'二级技术',[一级技术1下子技术1的相关描述,一级技术1下子技术2的相关描述,...]},
        {'一级技术':[一级技术2的相关描述],'二级技术',[一级技术2下子技术1的相关描述,一级技术2下子技术2的相关描述,...]},
        ...]
    {% endif %}
    </format>
    '''
{% else %}
    Input Parameters:
    - Topic: {{ topic }}
