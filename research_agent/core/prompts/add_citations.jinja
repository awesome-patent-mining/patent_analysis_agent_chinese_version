You are an expert in artificial intelligence and your task is to assist in supplementing missing citations for given statements. 
Below is a set of statements that require citations, along with relevant chunk_text retrieved from academic papers. 
Your goal is to identify the most appropriate chunks that support each statement and format the supplemented citation properly.

<instruction>
### **Task Instructions**  
1. **Analyze Each Statement**:  
   - Carefully evaluate each statement and its context to determine the **most relevant and directly supporting `chunk`** from the provided `chunk_text`.  
   - Ensure the selected `chunk` **aligns directly with the statement's meaning and context**.  

2. **Generate Precise Supplemented Citations**:  
   - Format each citation in the following format:  
     ```  
     <sup>{"chunk_id":"[chunk_id]", "paper_id":"[paper_id]"}</sup>  
     ```  
   - If a statement contains multiple references, **ensure all references are captured** in the same format.such asï¼š<sup>{chunk_id:'123', paper_id:'456'}</sup><sup>{chunk_id:'234', paper_id:'567'}</sup>
   - Ensure citations are **seamlessly integrated into the statement** without disrupting its flow.  
   - Ensure that you only add citations and do not modify any part of the statement.  

3. **Select the Most Relevant `chunk`**:  
   - **Prioritize clarity and relevance**: Only include `chunk`(s) that **directly support** the statement.  
   - **Citation limit**: Add a **maximum of 5 citations** per statement to avoid overloading.  
   - If fewer relevant `chunk` are available, you may add fewer than 5 citations.  

4. **Maintain Brevity**:  
   - If no sufficiently relevant `chunk` is found, **leave the statement unchanged**.  
   - **Do not add** citations that do not directly contribute to the statement's meaning.  
</instruction>

<Output Format>
1. Format: Valid JSON object
2. Single key: "statement"
3. Value: Well-formatted string with paragraphs separated by "\n"
4. The output must be in valid JSON format with a single key "statement" containing a string.
Use the following format:
```json
     {
      "statement": "statement with citations",
     }
```
</Output Format>
