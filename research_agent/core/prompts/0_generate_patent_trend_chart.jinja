Output:
{   "overall_trend": "Based on the earliest priority year of patents, we analyzed 379 patent applications after screening, resulting in the patent application trend analysis chart shown below. The chart compares the application trends of foreign countries, China, and the global total. In the field of 'Development of Curtain Airbag Gas Generators for Automobiles', related patents first appeared in the 1990s, showing a fluctuating pattern with some ups and downs in the overall application trend. In this field, foreign patent applications show significant fluctuations with periodic changes, with more applications in the early stages and a clear downward trend in later years. Chinese patent applications were relatively low in the early stages, developing slowly, but gradually increased after entering this century, especially after 2015 when patent applications grew rapidly. Based on the changes in patent application trends in this field, its development can be divided into the exploratory development period (1990-2000), high-level fluctuation period (2001-2014), and scale development period (2015-2024).",

Japan and the United States had the most research during this stage, with Germany, France, and South Korea also having some patent applications. Foreign research during this period mainly focused on high-burning-rate, high-heat, low-hygroscopic gas-generating agent formulation technology, representing the initial exploration stage of curtain airbag gas generator structural design."},

                    "description": "During this stage, foreign patent applications showed a clear downward trend, while Chinese patent applications began to grow significantly and gradually surpassed foreign applications. Due to the first-mover advantage of foreign countries, imported components had already occupied a large share of the domestic market, with relatively mature and stable technology and reduced demand for innovation and improvement. In contrast, based on the need for independent control of key components, relevant regulations on side impact occupant protection requirements, and the continuous rise in domestic automobile production, related enterprises have accelerated their R&D process in recent years, heavily investing in and patenting both the overall structural design technology of gas generators and high-burning-rate, high-heat, low-hygroscopic gas-generating agent formulation technology."}]
