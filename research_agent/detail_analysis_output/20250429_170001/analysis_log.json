    "trand_part": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the given period shows a significant increase in applications from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the overall trend, showing a sharp rise from 2017 to 2020, while US applications remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Global applications mirror the trend of Chinese applications, indicating China's growing influence in this technology field. The data suggests a rapid development phase followed by a stabilization or decline in recent years.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were minimal, with only sporadic filings. Both China and the US had very few applications, indicating the early stages of technology exploration and development. The US had a slight edge with one application in 2013, while China had one application in 2007 and another in 2013. The global patent landscape was similarly sparse, reflecting the nascent state of the technology during this period.\n\nThe top applicants during this period included EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC, Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., and Internal Sales Company. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US focused on a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, emphasizing a multi-layer software architecture to determine the best model based on prediction error. Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning to classify and reduce data dimensions, aiming to establish mapping relationships between classified data groups. Internal Sales Company from China proposed an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which used quality values to weight training instances differently, allowing the classifier to learn more from higher-quality instances. These early innovations laid the groundwork for more advanced machine learning techniques and applications in subsequent years.\n\n### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)\n\nDuring the rapid growth period, China significantly outpaced the US in patent applications, reflecting a strong focus on technological advancements and R&D efforts. Chinese applications surged from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, while US applications grew more modestly from 1 to 8 in the same period. This trend indicates China's dominant role in driving global patent activity, particularly in the field of machine learning and AI technologies. The US maintained a steady but slower growth rate, focusing on refining existing technologies and exploring new applications.\n\nGoogle LLC (China) led the way with a focus on unsupervised and federated learning techniques, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize data augmentation and model training efficiency. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC (US) concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as highlighted in US11803758B2 and US20210326751A, showcasing advancements in model robustness and adaptability.
