![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png "Patent Application Trend Chart")

The patent application trend in the given period shows a significant increase in applications from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the overall trend, showing a sharp rise from 2017 to 2020, while US applications remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Global applications mirror the trend of Chinese applications, indicating China's growing influence in this technology field. The data suggests a rapid development phase followed by a stabilization or decline in recent years.
### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)

During the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were minimal, with only sporadic filings. Both China and the US had very few applications, indicating the early stages of technology exploration and development. The US had a slight edge with one application in 2013, while China had one application in 2007 and another in 2013. The global patent landscape was similarly sparse, reflecting the nascent state of the technology during this period.

The top applicants during this period included EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC, Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., and Internal Sales Company. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US focused on a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, emphasizing a multi-layer software architecture to determine the best model based on prediction error. Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning to classify and reduce data dimensions, aiming to establish mapping relationships between classified data groups. Internal Sales Company from China proposed an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which used quality values to weight training instances differently, allowing the classifier to learn more from higher-quality instances. These early innovations laid the groundwork for more advanced machine learning techniques and applications in subsequent years.

### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)

During the rapid growth period, China significantly outpaced the US in patent applications, reflecting a strong focus on technological advancements and R&D efforts. Chinese applications surged from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, while US applications grew more modestly from 1 to 8 in the same period. This trend indicates China's dominant role in driving global patent activity, particularly in the field of machine learning and AI technologies. The US maintained a steady but slower growth rate, focusing on refining existing technologies and exploring new applications.

Google LLC (China) led the way with a focus on unsupervised and federated learning techniques, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize data augmentation and model training efficiency. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC (US) concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as highlighted in US11803758B2 and US20210326751A, showcasing advancements in model robustness and adaptability. International Business Machines Corporation (China) explored fairness improvements in supervised learning and data anonymization, as demonstrated in CN113692594A and CN112005255B, reflecting a commitment to ethical AI development. Visa International Service Association (China) focused on privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, as seen in CN114730389B and CN116756602A, addressing the growing need for secure data processing. HRL Laboratories, LLC (US) contributed to understanding machine-learning decisions based on camera data, as evidenced in US20180293464A1 and WO2018187608A1, highlighting advancements in interpretability and transparency in AI systems. Each applicant's technical route reflects their strategic priorities, with Chinese institutions emphasizing scalability and efficiency, while US companies focus on robustness, fairness, and interpretability.

### (3)Stabilization and Decline Period (2021-2024)

During the stabilization and decline period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence experienced a noticeable decline, particularly in China, where the number of applications dropped significantly after peaking in 2020. This suggests a maturation of the technology in China, with reduced innovation activity. In contrast, the United States maintained a relatively stable number of applications, although there was a slight decline in recent years. This indicates that while the technology is still evolving in the US, the pace of innovation has slowed. Globally, the trend also reflects a stabilization, with fewer new patents being filed, suggesting that the technology may be reaching a plateau in terms of novel developments.

The technical routes of the top five applicants during this period reveal distinct focuses and innovations. Oracle International Corporation emphasized the development of unsupervised machine learning models and chatbot systems for defining machine learning solutions. Their patents, such as US12020131B2 and US11847578B2, highlight the use of gating networks and natural language processing to optimize model selection and user interaction. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC focused on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as seen in US20240013055A1 and WO2021221801A1, which introduce methods for improving model robustness and training efficiency through noise addition and sub-goal based shaped reward functions. South China University of Technology (华南理工大学) contributed to the field with patents like CN113011526A and CN114692732A, which integrate reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning for robotic skill acquisition and online label updating, showcasing a strong emphasis on practical applications and model adaptability. Capital One Services, LLC explored dynamic content selection using deep reinforcement learning, as evidenced by US20220215244A1 and WO2022150152A1, which leverage real-time data to enhance prediction accuracy in dynamic environments. DataTang (数据堂(北京)科技股份有限公司) focused on data annotation methods, with patents like CN113205163B and CN113205163A, which combine unsupervised, weak, and semi-supervised learning to reduce manual annotation costs and improve efficiency. Overall, while US companies like Oracle and Microsoft continued to innovate in model optimization and training techniques, Chinese institutions like South China University of Technology and DataTang demonstrated a strong focus on practical applications and cost-effective solutions, highlighting the unique innovation characteristics of Chinese research institutions in this field.
