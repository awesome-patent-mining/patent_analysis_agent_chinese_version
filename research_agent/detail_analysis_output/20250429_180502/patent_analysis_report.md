### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)

During the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and distributed systems were sporadic and low in number. Both China and the US had minimal activity, with only a few applications recorded globally. This stage represents the early exploration and initial development of the technology, with no significant dominance by any particular country. The technology was in its infancy, with limited research and development efforts globally.

EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US focused on developing a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems. Their approach involved a multi-layer software architecture that implemented training, prediction, and metric functions in a C++ layer, iterating processing of different subsets of a data set with various models in a Python layer. This innovation aimed to determine the best model based on the smallest average prediction error across all database segments. Fuji Xerox from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and supervised learning to determine mapping relationships between classified data groups. This approach highlighted the integration of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Internal Sales Company from China introduced an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which used quality values associated with training instances to train a classifier. This method emphasized the importance of weighting training instances based on their quality, allowing the classifier to learn more from higher-quality instances. These innovations collectively represent the early stages of machine learning technology development, focusing on foundational frameworks, data processing methods, and instance-weighted learning models.
