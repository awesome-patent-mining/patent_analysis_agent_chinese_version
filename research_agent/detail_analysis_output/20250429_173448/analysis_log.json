    "trand_part": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the given period shows a significant increase in activity, particularly from 2017 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the landscape, especially from 2019 to 2020, where there is a sharp rise in numbers. Foreign applications, particularly from the US, show a more modest increase and remain relatively stable compared to the surge in Chinese applications. The global trend mirrors the Chinese trajectory, indicating a strong influence from China in the overall patent activity.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2013)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were minimal, with only a few filings from China and the US. This indicates that the technology was in its nascent stage, with limited global interest and activity. Both countries were exploring foundational aspects of machine learning, with China focusing on unsupervised and supervised learning methods, while the US was developing frameworks for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms on distributed systems.\n\nThe technical routes of the top applicants during this period reflect the early exploration of machine learning technologies. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC in the US developed a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, emphasizing the importance of distributed computing in machine learning. Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. in China focused on data processing methods that combined unsupervised and supervised learning to reduce data dimensionality and establish mapping relationships between data sets. Internal Sales Company in China introduced an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which emphasized the quality of training instances to improve classifier performance. These approaches highlight the initial efforts to address key challenges in machine learning, such as data processing, model validation, and instance weighting, laying the groundwork for future advancements in the field.\n\n### (2)Growth Period (2017-2020)\n\nDuring the growth period, China exhibited a significant surge in patent applications, reflecting a strong focus on technological development and innovation. The number of Chinese applications increased dramatically, from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a robust investment in research and development.
