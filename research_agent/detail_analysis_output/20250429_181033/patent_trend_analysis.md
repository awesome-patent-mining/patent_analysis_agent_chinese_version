![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png "Patent Application Trend Chart")

The patent application trend in the given period shows a significant increase in applications, particularly from China, starting from 2017. The global trend mirrors this growth, peaking in 2020 before declining. Foreign applications, primarily from the US, show a more stable but lower volume compared to China. The data suggests a rapid development phase in China, while foreign applications remain relatively steady.
### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)

During the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were minimal, with only sporadic filings from China and the US. The technology was in its nascent stage, with limited global interest and development. The US showed early activity with a patent in 2013, while China had a patent in 2007 and another in 2013. The global patent count remained low, indicating that the technology was still in the exploratory phase with limited commercial or industrial adoption.

EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US focused on cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, as seen in their 2013 patent US9235813B1. This patent introduced a multi-layer software architecture for training, prediction, and metric functions, emphasizing the importance of distributed systems in machine learning. Fuji Xerox from China, with their 2007 patent CN101206727B, developed a data processing device that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning for dimensionality reduction and mapping relationships between data sets. This approach highlighted the integration of different learning methods to enhance data processing efficiency. Internal Sales Company, also from China, introduced an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model in their 2013 patent CN104956359A. This model emphasized the importance of quality values in training instances, using weighted factors to improve classifier training. The technical routes of these applicants varied, with EMC focusing on distributed systems, Fuji Xerox on integrated learning methods, and Internal Sales Company on weighted learning models. These differences reflect the diverse approaches to machine learning and data processing during this early stage of development.

### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)

During the Rapid Growth Period, China experienced a significant surge in patent applications, increasing from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a strong focus on technological innovation and development. The United States also saw a steady increase, though not as dramatic, with applications rising from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. Globally, patent applications surged from 8 in 2017 to 41 in 2020, reflecting a period of intense innovation and competition in the technology sector. This period highlights China's growing influence in the global technology landscape, particularly in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

During the Rapid Growth Period, the top 5 applicants demonstrated distinct technical routes in their patent applications. Google LLC focused on unsupervised and federated learning techniques, with patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A emphasizing data augmentation and model training without labeled data. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as seen in US11803758B2 and US20210326751A, which involve adding noise to training data and optimizing model configurations. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) explored fairness improvement in supervised learning through reinforcement learning, as highlighted in CN113692594A, and data anonymization techniques in CN112005255B. Visa International Service Association focused on privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, with patents like CN114730389B and CN116756602A addressing secure distance computation and data anonymization. HRL Laboratories, LLC specialized in understanding machine-learning decisions based on camera data, with patents like US20180293464A and WO2018187608A focusing on unsupervised concept extraction and visualization. These diverse approaches reflect the varied strategies and innovations in machine learning and AI during this period, with Chinese institutions like Google LLC and IBM making significant contributions to the field.

### (3)Decline and Stabilization Period (2021-2024)

During the decline and stabilization period, Chinese patent applications experienced a significant drop from 32 in 2020 to just 1 in 2024, indicating a slowdown in technological innovation or market saturation in China. In contrast, foreign patent applications, particularly from the US, remained relatively stable, suggesting continued investment and development in the technology. This divergence highlights a potential shift in focus, with foreign entities maintaining their technological advancements while China may be transitioning to other areas or consolidating existing technologies.

The top 5 applicants during this period demonstrate diverse technical routes in machine learning and AI. Oracle International Corporation focused on unsupervised model ensembling and chatbot-driven machine learning solutions, emphasizing efficiency and user accessibility. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC explored adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning with sub-goal based shaped reward functions, aiming to enhance model robustness and adaptability. South China University of Technology (华南理工大学) developed methods combining reinforcement and unsupervised learning for robot skill acquisition and online label updating, showcasing innovation in practical applications. Capital One Services, LLC leveraged deep reinforcement learning for dynamic content selection in real-time environments, highlighting their focus on real-time decision-making. DataTang (数据堂(北京)科技股份有限公司) concentrated on data annotation methods using unsupervised, weak, and semi-supervised learning, aiming to reduce manual labeling costs and improve efficiency. Chinese research institutions, particularly South China University of Technology, stood out for their innovative approaches to integrating multiple learning paradigms, reflecting a strong emphasis on practical, real-world applications and efficiency improvements in AI technologies.
