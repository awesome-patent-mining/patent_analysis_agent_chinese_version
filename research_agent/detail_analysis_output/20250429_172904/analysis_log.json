    "trand_part": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend analysis reveals a significant increase in patent applications globally, particularly from China, starting from 2017. Foreign applications, primarily from the US, show a more stable but less pronounced growth compared to China. The data indicates a rapid development phase for China in the technology sector, while foreign applications maintain a steady presence.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were minimal, with only sporadic filings from China and the US. This stage represents the early exploration and foundational development of the technology. The US had a slight edge in the number of applications, particularly in advanced frameworks for machine learning algorithms, while China focused more on practical applications and methods for data processing and classification.\n\nEMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US proposed a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, which laid the groundwork for scalable and efficient machine learning model validation. Fuji Xerox from China introduced a data processing device and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning for dimensionality reduction and mapping relationships, showcasing early innovation in data classification. Internal Sales Company from China developed an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which emphasized the importance of quality values in training classifiers, highlighting a focus on improving model accuracy through weighted learning. These early contributions from both US and Chinese companies set the stage for future advancements in machine learning and data processing technologies.\n\n### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)\n\nDuring the rapid growth period, China experienced a significant surge in patent applications, increasing from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a strong focus on technological innovation. The US also saw an increase in patent applications, but at a slower pace, growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. This period highlights China's growing dominance in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, while the US maintained a steady but less aggressive growth trajectory.\n\nGoogle LLC (China) led the way with a focus on unsupervised data augmentation and federated learning, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize enhancing model training through data augmentation and federated learning techniques. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC (US) concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as evidenced by patents like US11803758B2 and US20210326751A, which focus on improving model robustness and training efficiency through adversarial methods. IBM (China) focused on fairness improvement in supervised learning and data anonymization, as shown in patents like CN113692594A and CN112005255B, which aim to enhance model fairness and data privacy. Visa International Service Association (China) prioritized privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, as seen in patents like CN114730389B and CN116756602A, which emphasize secure and efficient unsupervised learning methods. HRL Laboratories, LLC (US) explored understanding machine-learning decisions based on camera data, as highlighted in patents like US20180293464A1 and WO2018187608A1, which focus on interpreting and visualizing machine-learning decisions. Each applicant's technical route reflects their strategic priorities, with Chinese institutions like Google LLC and IBM emphasizing data augmentation, federated learning, and fairness, while US-based companies like Microsoft and HRL Laboratories focus on adversarial training, reinforcement learning, and decision interpretation.\n\n### (3)Stabilization Period (2021-2024)\n\nDuring the stabilization period, the number of patent applications in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence began to stabilize, with a noticeable decrease in applications from China and a slight decrease from the US. This suggests a maturing technology landscape with reduced innovation activity. The US maintained a steady presence in patent applications, indicating continued but more focused innovation. China's decline in patent applications may reflect a shift towards optimizing existing technologies rather than exploring new ones. Globally, the trend indicates a consolidation of advancements in machine learning, with fewer but potentially more impactful innovations.\n\nThe top five applicants during this period demonstrate diverse technical routes in machine learning and AI. Oracle International Corporation focused on unsupervised learning models and chatbot-driven machine learning solutions, emphasizing efficiency and user accessibility. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC explored adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning with sub-goal-based shaped reward functions, aiming to enhance model robustness and adaptability. South China University of Technology (华南理工大学) developed methods combining reinforcement and unsupervised learning for robotic skill acquisition and online label updating, showcasing innovation in practical applications. Capital One Services, LLC leveraged deep reinforcement learning for dynamic content selection in real-time environments, highlighting the integration of AI in financial services. DataTang (数据堂(北京)科技股份有限公司) concentrated on data annotation methods using unsupervised, weakly supervised, and semi-supervised learning, addressing efficiency and cost reduction in data processing. These applicants collectively represent a shift towards refining and applying machine learning technologies in diverse domains, with a focus on improving model performance, reducing costs, and enhancing user interaction.\n\n",
