## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis
![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png "Patent Application Trend Chart")

The patent application trend in the field of 'Development of Curtain Airbag Gas Generators for Automobiles' shows a significant increase from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the field, especially from 2017 to 2020, where they show a rapid increase. Foreign applications, particularly from the US, remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The global trend mirrors the Chinese trend, indicating China's significant contribution to the overall patent landscape in this field.
### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2013)

During the initial development period, patent applications in the field of curtain airbag gas generator technology were minimal, with only a few applications from China and the US. This stage represents the early exploration and foundational development of the technology. Both countries showed limited activity, indicating that the technology was in its nascent phase, with no significant dominance by either country. The global patent count was also low, suggesting that the technology had not yet gained widespread attention or adoption.

The top applicants during this period were primarily focused on machine learning and data processing technologies, rather than curtain airbag gas generator technology. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US filed a patent related to cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, highlighting their focus on advanced data analytics. Fuji Xerox from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, indicating their interest in machine learning applications. Internal Sales Company from China also contributed with a patent on instance-weighted learning for machine learning models, emphasizing their focus on improving machine learning model training. These applicants' focus on machine learning and data processing suggests that the curtain airbag gas generator technology was not a primary area of innovation during this period, and the field was still in its early stages of development.

### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)

During the rapid growth period, China demonstrated a significant surge in patent applications, particularly in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The number of Chinese applications rose sharply from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a strong focus on innovation and development in this area. In contrast, the US showed a more modest increase, with applications growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. This period highlights China's aggressive push towards technological advancements in AI, while the US maintained a steady but less pronounced growth trajectory.

The top five applicants during this period, including Google LLC, Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, IBM, Visa International Service Association, and HRL Laboratories, LLC, showcased diverse technical routes in machine learning and AI. Google LLC focused on unsupervised data augmentation and federated learning, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize enhancing model training through data augmentation and decentralized learning. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as evidenced by US11803758B2 and US11526812B2, which aim to improve model robustness and adaptability. IBM's patents, such as CN113692594A, highlighted fairness improvements in supervised learning through reinforcement learning, addressing ethical concerns in AI. Visa International Service Association explored privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, as seen in CN114730389B, focusing on secure data processing. HRL Laboratories, LLC, delved into understanding machine-learning decisions based on camera data, as shown in US20180293464A1, which aims to interpret and visualize AI decision-making processes. These diverse approaches reflect the broad spectrum of innovation in AI during this period, with each company addressing unique challenges and applications.

### (3)Decline Period (2021-2024)

During the decline period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence experienced a significant drop globally, particularly in China, where applications decreased sharply. In contrast, US applications remained relatively stable, indicating a continued focus on innovation in this area. The global decline reflects reduced activity and possibly market saturation or a shift in research priorities. Foreign patents, especially from the US, continued to dominate, with a focus on advanced machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and chatbot technologies. Chinese patents, while fewer in number, still contributed to the field with innovations in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, particularly in applications like robotics and data annotation.

The top five applicants during this period demonstrated distinct technical routes. Oracle International Corporation focused on unsupervised machine learning models and chatbot technologies, emphasizing the optimization of ensemble models and natural language processing for machine learning solutions. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC explored adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, with a particular emphasis on self-supervised learning and sub-goal-based reward functions. South China University of Technology contributed to the field with innovations in reinforcement and unsupervised learning, particularly in robotics and online label updating, showcasing a strong focus on practical applications. Capital One Services, LLC specialized in deep reinforcement learning for dynamic content selection, leveraging cross-channel, time-bound techniques to enhance prediction accuracy in dynamic environments. DataTang (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. focused on data annotation methods, combining unsupervised, weak, and semi-supervised learning to reduce manual labeling costs and improve efficiency. Chinese research institutions, such as South China University of Technology and DataTang, highlighted their innovation characteristics by addressing practical challenges in robotics and data annotation, demonstrating a strong emphasis on real-world applications and efficiency improvements.
