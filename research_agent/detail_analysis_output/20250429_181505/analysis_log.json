The number of Chinese applications rose sharply from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a strong focus on innovation and development in this area. In contrast, the US showed a more modest increase, with applications growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. This period highlights China's aggressive push towards technological advancements in AI, while the US maintained a steady but less pronounced growth trajectory.\n\nThe top five applicants during this period, including Google LLC, Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, IBM, Visa International Service Association, and HRL Laboratories, LLC, showcased diverse technical routes in machine learning and AI. Google LLC focused on unsupervised data augmentation and federated learning, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize enhancing model training through data augmentation and decentralized learning. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, concentrated on adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, as evidenced by US11803758B2 and US11526812B2, which aim to improve model robustness and adaptability. IBM's patents, such as CN113692594A, highlighted fairness improvements in supervised learning through reinforcement learning, addressing ethical concerns in AI. Visa International Service Association explored privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, as seen in CN114730389B, focusing on secure data processing. HRL Laboratories, LLC, delved into understanding machine-learning decisions based on camera data, as shown in US20180293464A1, which aims to interpret and visualize AI decision-making processes. These diverse approaches reflect the broad spectrum of innovation in AI during this period, with each company addressing unique challenges and applications.\n\n### (3)Decline Period (2021-2024)\n\nDuring the decline period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence experienced a significant drop globally, particularly in China, where applications decreased sharply. In contrast, US applications remained relatively stable, indicating a continued focus on innovation in this area. The global decline reflects reduced activity and possibly market saturation or a shift in research priorities. Foreign patents, especially from the US, continued to dominate, with a focus on advanced machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and chatbot technologies. Chinese patents, while fewer in number, still contributed to the field with innovations in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, particularly in applications like robotics and data annotation.\n\nThe top five applicants during this period demonstrated distinct technical routes. Oracle International Corporation focused on unsupervised machine learning models and chatbot technologies, emphasizing the optimization of ensemble models and natural language processing for machine learning solutions. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC explored adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, with a particular emphasis on self-supervised learning and sub-goal-based reward functions. South China University of Technology contributed to the field with innovations in reinforcement and unsupervised learning, particularly in robotics and online label updating, showcasing a strong focus on practical applications. Capital One Services, LLC specialized in deep reinforcement learning for dynamic content selection, leveraging cross-channel, time-bound techniques to enhance prediction accuracy in dynamic environments. DataTang (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. focused on data annotation methods, combining unsupervised, weak, and semi-supervised learning to reduce manual labeling costs and improve efficiency. Chinese research institutions, such as South China University of Technology and DataTang, highlighted their innovation characteristics by addressing practical challenges in robotics and data annotation, demonstrating a strong emphasis on real-world applications and efficiency improvements.\n\n",
