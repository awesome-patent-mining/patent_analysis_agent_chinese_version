![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png "Patent Application Trend Chart")

The patent application trend in the field of 'Development of Curtain Airbag Gas Generators for Automobiles' shows a significant increase from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the field, especially from 2017 to 2020, where they show a rapid increase. Foreign applications, particularly from the US, remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The global trend mirrors the Chinese trend, indicating China's significant contribution to the overall patent landscape in this field.
### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2013)

During the initial development period, patent applications in the field of curtain airbag gas generator technology were minimal, with only a few applications from China and the US. This stage represents the early exploration and foundational development of the technology. Both countries showed limited activity, indicating that the technology was in its nascent phase, with no significant dominance by either country. The global patent count was also low, suggesting that the technology had not yet gained widespread attention or adoption.

The top applicants during this period were primarily focused on machine learning and data processing technologies, rather than curtain airbag gas generator technology. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US filed a patent related to cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, highlighting their focus on advanced data analytics. Fuji Xerox from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, indicating their interest in machine learning applications. Internal Sales Company from China also contributed with a patent on instance-weighted learning for machine learning models, emphasizing their focus on improving machine learning model training. These applicants' focus on machine learning and data processing suggests that the curtain airbag gas generator technology was not a primary area of innovation during this period, and the field was still in its early stages of development.

### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)

During the rapid growth period, China demonstrated a significant surge in patent applications, particularly in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The number of Chinese applications rose sharply from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a strong focus on innovation and development in this area. In contrast, the US showed a more modest increase, with applications growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. This period highlights China's aggressive push towards technological advancements in AI, while the US maintained a steady but less pronounced growth trajectory.

The top five applicants during this period, including Google LLC, Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, IBM, Visa International Service Association, and HRL Laboratories, LLC, showcased diverse technical routes in machine learning and AI. Google LLC focused on unsupervised data augmentation and federated learning, as seen in patents like CN113826125A and CN116134453A, which emphasize enhancing model training through data augmentation and decentralized learning.
