![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png "Patent Application Trend Chart")

The patent application trend analysis reveals a significant increase in patent applications globally, particularly from China, starting from 2017. Foreign applications, primarily from the US, show a more stable but less pronounced growth pattern. Chinese applications dominate the global trend, especially from 2019 to 2020, indicating a rapid development phase in technology. The overall trend suggests a shift from a period of low activity to a phase of rapid growth and subsequent stabilization.
### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)

During the initial development period, patent activity in the field of machine learning and data processing was very low, with only sporadic applications from China and the US. This indicates that the technology was in its nascent stage with minimal global interest. The US had a slight edge in terms of innovation, with EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC filing a patent on cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems. China, represented by Fuji Xerox and Internal Sales Company, focused on unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, as well as instance-weighted learning models, showing a growing interest in foundational machine learning methodologies.

Fuji Xerox from China introduced a data processing device and method that combined unsupervised and supervised learning to reduce data dimensionality and establish mapping relationships between classified data groups. Internal Sales Company, also from China, developed an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which used quality values to weight training instances differently, allowing classifiers to learn more from higher-quality instances. These innovations highlight the early-stage exploration of machine learning techniques, with the US focusing on distributed systems and China emphasizing foundational learning methodologies and data processing techniques.

### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)

During the rapid growth period, China experienced a dramatic increase in patent applications, rising from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020, indicating a significant surge in technological development and innovation. The US also saw an increase in patent applications, but at a slower rate. This period highlights China's growing dominance in technological advancements, particularly in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, while the US maintained a steady but less pronounced growth.

During the rapid growth period, the top 5 applicants demonstrated distinct technical routes in machine learning and AI. Google LLC focused on unsupervised data augmentation and federated learning, emphasizing the enhancement of model training through data manipulation and distributed learning. Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC explored adversarial pretraining and reinforcement learning, aiming to improve model robustness and adaptability through noise injection and reward shaping.
