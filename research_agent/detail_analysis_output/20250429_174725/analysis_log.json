    "trand_part": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the given period shows a significant increase in applications from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the overall trend, showing a rapid increase from 2017 to 2020, while US applications remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Global applications mirror the trend of Chinese applications, indicating China's growing influence in this field. The data suggests a peak in innovation activity around 2020, followed by a gradual decline.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the Initial Development Period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were sporadic and limited in number. Both China and the US showed minimal activity, with only a few applications recorded. This stage represents the early exploration of the technology, with limited innovation and development. The global patent applications were also low, indicating that the technology was in its nascent stage with limited international interest.\n\nThe top applicants during this period focused on foundational aspects of machine learning and data processing. EMC IP HOLDING COMPANY LLC from the US proposed a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms using SQL on distributed systems, emphasizing the importance of distributed computing in machine learning. Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. from China developed a data processing apparatus and method that utilized unsupervised and supervised learning to classify and reduce the dimensionality of data sets, highlighting the integration of different learning paradigms. Internal Sales Company from China introduced an instance-weighted learning (IWL) machine learning model, which emphasized the importance of quality values in training classifiers, showcasing the early exploration of weighted learning techniques.
