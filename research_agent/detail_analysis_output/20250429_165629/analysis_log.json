    "full_report": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the field of interest shows a significant increase from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline in recent years. Chinese patent applications dominate the overall trend, with a sharp rise starting in 2017 and peaking in 2020. Foreign applications, particularly from the US, show a more stable but lower volume compared to China. The global trend mirrors the Chinese trajectory, indicating China's growing influence in this technological domain.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were sporadic and low in volume. Both China and the US had minimal activity, with only a few applications recorded globally. This stage represents the early exploration and initial development of the technology, with no significant dominance by any particular country.
