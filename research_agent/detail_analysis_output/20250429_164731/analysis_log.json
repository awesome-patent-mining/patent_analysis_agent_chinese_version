    "trand_part": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the field shows a significant increase from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the trend, showing rapid growth from 2017 to 2020, while US applications remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Global applications mirror the trend of Chinese applications, indicating China's strong influence in this field.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were sporadic, with minimal activity from both China and the US. The first patent in this period was filed in 2007 by Fuji Xerox in China, focusing on unsupervised and supervised learning for data processing. In 2013, EMC IP Holding Company LLC in the US filed a patent for a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms on distributed systems, indicating the early stages of technological exploration in this field. The low number of patents suggests that this was a foundational period where basic concepts and frameworks were being established.\n\nThe top applicants during this period were EMC IP Holding Company LLC, Fuji Xerox, and Internal Sales Company. EMC IP Holding Company LLC focused on developing a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms on distributed systems, which laid the groundwork for scalable machine learning solutions. Fuji Xerox's patent in 2007 introduced a data processing device that utilized unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and supervised learning for mapping relationships between data sets, showcasing an early integration of different learning paradigms. Internal Sales Company's patent in 2013 introduced instance-weighted learning (IWL) for training classifiers, emphasizing the importance of quality values in training instances. These patents reflect the initial exploration of machine learning techniques, with a focus on foundational algorithms, data processing, and scalable solutions. The technical routes of these applicants highlight the diversity in early approaches to machine learning, from cross-validation frameworks to integrated learning systems and weighted training methods.\n\n### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)\n\nDuring the Rapid Growth Period, China emerged as the dominant force in patent applications, with a significant surge from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020. The United States also saw an increase in patent applications, but at a slower pace, growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. Globally, the trend closely followed China's growth, indicating its leadership in this technological field.

    "full_report": "## (1) Patent Application Trend Analysis\n![Trend Chart](./trend_chart.png \"Patent Application Trend Chart\")\n\nThe patent application trend in the field shows a significant increase from 2007 to 2020, followed by a decline from 2021 onwards. Chinese patent applications dominate the trend, showing rapid growth from 2017 to 2020, while US applications remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Global applications mirror the trend of Chinese applications, indicating China's strong influence in this field.\n### (1)Initial Development Period (2007-2016)\n\nDuring the initial development period, patent applications in the field of machine learning and data processing were sporadic, with minimal activity from both China and the US. The first patent in this period was filed in 2007 by Fuji Xerox in China, focusing on unsupervised and supervised learning for data processing. In 2013, EMC IP Holding Company LLC in the US filed a patent for a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms on distributed systems, indicating the early stages of technological exploration in this field. The low number of patents suggests that this was a foundational period where basic concepts and frameworks were being established.\n\nThe top applicants during this period were EMC IP Holding Company LLC, Fuji Xerox, and Internal Sales Company. EMC IP Holding Company LLC focused on developing a general framework for cross-validation of machine learning algorithms on distributed systems, which laid the groundwork for scalable machine learning solutions. Fuji Xerox's patent in 2007 introduced a data processing device that utilized unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and supervised learning for mapping relationships between data sets, showcasing an early integration of different learning paradigms. Internal Sales Company's patent in 2013 introduced instance-weighted learning (IWL) for training classifiers, emphasizing the importance of quality values in training instances. These patents reflect the initial exploration of machine learning techniques, with a focus on foundational algorithms, data processing, and scalable solutions. The technical routes of these applicants highlight the diversity in early approaches to machine learning, from cross-validation frameworks to integrated learning systems and weighted training methods.\n\n### (2)Rapid Growth Period (2017-2020)\n\nDuring the Rapid Growth Period, China emerged as the dominant force in patent applications, with a significant surge from 7 in 2017 to 32 in 2020. The United States also saw an increase in patent applications, but at a slower pace, growing from 1 in 2017 to 8 in 2020. Globally, the trend closely followed China's growth, indicating its leadership in this technological field.
