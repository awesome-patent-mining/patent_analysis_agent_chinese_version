## 6 计算机视觉中的伦理问题

### 6.1 隐私保护

The widespread use of camera technology has brought privacy concerns to the forefront. Current research primarily focuses on the privacy issues of direct users of camera technology, such as owners or operators, and designs privacy enhancement mechanisms to protect their privacy [50, 71, 73]. In recent years, researchers have begun to explore the privacy concerns of bystanders around various types of camera technologies, such as life log cameras [34, 51], drones [66, 70], smart glasses [24], and smart home devices [7, 16, 42, 44, 69]. For example, Ahmad et al. [7] found that even with LED lights indicating camera status, bystanders find it difficult to distinguish between the 'on' and 'off' states of IoT devices. Wang et al. [66] revealed the discreet data collection and hidden drone users, which have increased the concerns of bystanders. Additionally, researchers have found that bystanders' privacy expectations vary depending on the situation, such as who is collecting the data [39], whether the space is private or public [66], and the relationship between the user and the bystander [69]. Interestingly, when cameras are used as assistive technology for people with disabilities, bystanders are often more willing to share their information. For instance, if smart glasses are used to support visually impaired users, they are considered more socially acceptable [57]. However, the information that bystanders are willing to share is limited [9]. Akter et al. [10] further revealed the shared ethical issues between visually impaired camera users and bystanders, such as AI technology's misrepresentation of bystanders. Despite previous research exploring the privacy perceptions of bystanders around various camera technologies, it mainly focused on visually impaired bystanders. There has been little attention to people with visual impairments who face severe visual challenges and may have unique perspectives on privacy perceptions and needs around cameras.

Explainability refers to the transparency of the decision-making process within a model, detailing how it makes decisions and the reasons behind them. In the field of computer vision, this is particularly crucial as it directly impacts the reliability of the model and the trust users place in it.
Current research indicates that many deep learning models are often viewed as 'black boxes', with complex internal mechanisms that are difficult to interpret. For instance, studies have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) may sometimes focus on non-critical features when identifying objects in images, leading to suboptimal recognition performance for certain images. Enhancing the explainability of models is therefore essential for improving their performance and fostering user confidence.
